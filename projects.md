## Elysia

_Currently on hold._

Elysia is a single-player 2D tactical RPG written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/)
and built on [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/). More information can be
found on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/Acid147/elysia).

## PixelPal

PixelPal is a tool for validating and converting the palette of image files.

When using third party pixel art assets, the palettes of different assets may
not match. To unify the look of these assets, you might want to convert their
color palettes to match.

More information can be found on the
[GitHub project page](https://github.com/Acid147/pixelpal). Download links can
be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Acid147/pixelpal/releases).
