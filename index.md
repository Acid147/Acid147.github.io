I'm a programmer and audio engineer from Switzerland, currently creating
different small [projects](https://acid147.github.io/projects.html) in my free
time.

After playing in several small bands, I began writing songs by myself. This,
together with experience in programming small games, soon developed into an
interest for the creation of video game music.
